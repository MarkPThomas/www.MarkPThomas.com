This is a new website I am building with multiple sub-sites that serve a variety of functions. The site will include some different professional sites, as well as a variety of hobby sites. My aim is to create a nice looking and dynamic website with a lot of interaction capability, and than be easily changed and extended. The site is based around a custom CMS system.

For now I am starting with building the site using the LAMP stack and MVC pattern, but later on I plan to add in Angular on the front end.
