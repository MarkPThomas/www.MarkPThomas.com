# Deflate Compression by FileType
# Following lines can allow you to compress the source files of your website but this requires mod_deflate.c module to be installed on your server.
# The source files of the website on the server are kept in compressed form and when the request comes from a user then these files are transferred in compressed form which are then uncompressed and executed on the server. 
# This improves the bandwidth constraint.
