    <p>This is my website for all map & GIS-related things.</p>

    <h2>Original Site</h2>
    <p>Originally I had a website at www.markpthomas.com, but Google has since deleted the site on their cloud storage.
        Fortunately I was already in the process of creating a new site and I had scraped most of the information from there and parsed it into a database for re-use.
        So all of the original trip reports at that site can still be found here either under www.markpthomas.com or www.markpthomas.net.
        The look is different and a bit more static now, but I will flesh out this new design over time to make a much better, more dynamic, and more useful website.</p>

    <h2>Current State</h2>
    <p>TBD.
        The main site home page can be found here: <a href="/">www.MarkPThomas.net</a>.
